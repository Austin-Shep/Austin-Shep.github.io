        <p> My name is Austin Shepherd. Hailing from the sleepy strip mall that is Fairfiled, CA, I have spent most of my life inhabiting the Great Central Valley. 
            I began my journey into the real world by taking a brief soujurn to the east coast, to meet family among other things.
            After returning west I found myself lost and without direction, aimlessly wandering from house to house and job to job. </p>
        <p>It took me almost 2 years and multiple attemps at higher education to find something that was both chalenging enough to keep me engaged and fufiling enough to keep me encouraged. 
            Web development filled that roll perfectly for me. Being a field that allows constant evolution of understanding and exponential growth in skill, i find myself constantly scrambling to find another project to engross myself in.  </p>
